## Setup

Housekeeping tasks to make our first few days run smoother.

### Accounts

If you don't have them already, sign up for free accounts on the following services:

* [GitHub](http://github.com) - The industry standard code host. You're looking at it right now!
* [Medium](http://medium.com) - You'll be writing blog posts during the course, for the purposes of both reflection and building your personal brand. Medium's interface is great.
* [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com) - An awesome *free* online code course.

For GitHub at least, *please* to set your real name and make your icon a picture of yourself. (I'm awful at remembering names and this will help.) E-mail me your GitHub username so I can add you to the organization in advance of the class.

### Computer Setup

All students need to be using a MacBook with OSX Yosemite. (To check the version, click on the Apple icon on the task bar, then "About This Mac.")

If you're on an older version of OSX, you can upgrade for free through the App Store. The upgrade takes a while to download, and then install, and requires a restart, so you might want to do it over lunch or an evening.

You're going to want to use a text editor that you're comfortable. Unlike "compiled" languages (like Java or C++), you can write fully functional JavaScript with any text editor in the world. [People have strong opinions on text editors!](http://xkcd.com/378/)

I'm going to use [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) in this class -- it's quick, stable, used by a preponderance of professional front-end devs, and has a bunch of useful add-ons I'll help you install. If you're comfortable with another advanced editor ([TextMate](http://macromates.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), etc), that's fine.

It's worth noting that a license for Sublime costs $70, but it's "free" to use for an unlimited time with just an occasional popup begging for money. After the class is complete, if you're still using Sublime, I'd recommend that you pay for it.

We're going to standardize this class on Google Chrome, so make sure you have that installed (preferably as your default browser).


## Prework

I don’t believe you can really learn to program by watching a few videos and answering some questions (and if you believed that, you probably wouldn’t be coming to The Iron Yard). However, skill acquisition takes a long time, and the work below will help introduce you to some of the ideas and skills that will form the foundation of your in-person learning experience.

Ideally, you should have this work done before you come to the class on Day 1, and if you can do everything (including hard mode), great! I have a ton of suggestions for leveled-up resources to learn from; email me at **kyle.hill@theironyard.com**. (Contact me if you have any questions about this prework as well.)

Reasonably, we're going to only spend a week covering this material before jumping into JavaScript, which is the bulk of the course. It's not important to *complete* everything, but it will be invaluable during the first few days if you're *familiar* with the underpinning concepts of everything. The second time you hear something, you learn it.

### HTML and CSS

HTML and CSS are the foundation of content on any webpage or web app. Again, we're only going be spending about a week on them, so you should have a basic foundation before the class starts.

Work on the [HTML and CSS](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web) Codecademy course. Completing it should take you around 6-8 hours, depending on your prior experience.

If you want to jump into building something, great! [Codepen](http://codepen.io) is a great free tool for playing with HTML and CSS and getting instant feedback. (We'll be using it on our first day.) Be sure to sign up for an account so things auto-save.

### Command Line

The command line (or "terminal") is the gateway to your computer's internals. It's a more direct and customizable way to do things that you'd usually do through a graphical user interface.

The command line can seem imposing and scary the first few times you're interacting with it. But: the two tools we're going to use the most as front end developers are the command line and a simple text editor, so we need to get comfortable with it.

Go through the first section of Treehouse's [Console Foundations course](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations#getting-started-with-the-console). Treehouse costs money, but if you create an account it's free for the first 14 days.

If you don't want to sign up for Treehouse, this [Lifehacker post](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything) does an alright decent job of demystifying the process of traversing around your computer's folder and file structure, much like you would in Finder.

Hard mode: Go through the "Users and Permissions" and "Processes" sections on the Treehouse course as well.

### Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

It is a command line tool that we will be using for every project we do in class. You don't need to become an expert before the class, but try to start getting comfortable.

Make sure you go through the [git tutorial](https://try.github.io) on GitHub.

GitHub has a [tutorial](https://guides.github.com/) for itself -- we won't use the advanced features it provides for the first couple weeks, but familiarizing yourself with it is awesome.

Hard mode: If you're comfortable with git already and itching for more, the [git immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) course is great.


### Typing

One of the main skills you'll develop as a programmer is hunting down bugs in your code - "I expected X to happen, but it didn't, and this line of code is where things start to go wrong." An embarrassing amount of these bugs -- for every programmer in the world, ever -- are simple typing and spelling errors.

If you don't know how to touch type (i.e. type without looking at the keyboard), try to spend some time each day working on touch typing (you can try [keybr.com](http://keybr.com)). If you already know how to touch type, I would highly recommend working through the JavaScript lessons on [typing.io](http://typing.io). Don't worry about what the code's actually doing. Just try and get comfortable with stroking special characters as often as you stroke letters.

### Learning
Finally, if you’re interested in learning how best to study and learn, many of the principles that I use to design our course can be found in the book [Make It Stick](http://www.amazon.com/Make-It-Stick-Successful-Learning/dp/0674729013). Reading it isn't required, but a lot of people have found that it helps.
