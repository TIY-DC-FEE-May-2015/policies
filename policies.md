## Policies

### Attendance

You can miss up to 4 lectures before your career support is forfeit. I don't recommend missing any, as we will be moving very fast and every single day builds on content and discussion from the day before.

If you know you're going to miss something, reach out to myself (or Su) and we'll figure what the best way forward is -- likely a Google Hangouts session, if possible.

Lecture starts promptly at 9am; we need everyone ready to go then so we can cover all of the materials. Being 15 minutes late, twice, counts as one absence.

### Daily Schedule (Weeks 1-9)

*Monday-Thursday*

* Lecture from 9am to 12pm
* Lab from 1pm to 5pm
* Optional Review Session at 2pm

*Friday*

* Friday Huddle at 9am
* Lab until 4pm
* Review Session at 2pm
* **#IRONPINTS** at 4pm

Starting on Week 10, you'll be working on your final projects and we'll have a different schedule (much more Friday-like). Still gotta be here at 9am though ;)

There's a chance we'll have guest lecturers, field trips, and other fun stuff during the class that'll alter this schedule significantly on some days. Don't set your watch by it.

### Holidays and Exceptions

* **Monday, 5/25**: We'll be closed for Memorial Day. (From past experience, you'll want that extra day to work on the first week's homework assignments anyway.)

* **Friday, 7/3**: Since Independence Day falls on a Saturday this year, we're still debating whether or not to observe it and take the preceding day off. Let's assume for now that we'll be meeting for huddle and office hours, but if you need to be out of town, it's not the worst day to miss.

### Instructor Schedule

* **9am - 12pm**: Lecture
* **9am - 11am**: Office Hours (Friday Only)
* **1pm - 3pm**: Office Hours (includes Review)
* **3pm - 5pm**: Admin Time (possible Office Hours)

I schedule all of my meetings from 3pm on. If I'm free, I'll be in the office after 3, but don't count on it. If you ask me any questions via Slack during that time, I'll get you sorted out before I leave for the day.

There is a chance I will be available via Slack in the evenings or weekends. If I am and can help I will do so, but don't plan on this. Make sure to ask any questions you have before you leave for the day.
